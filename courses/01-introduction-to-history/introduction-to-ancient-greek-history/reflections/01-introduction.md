## Summary:
Professor Donald Kagan sets the scene for the content of this course. He talks about the greatness of Western civilisation and posits that the Ancient Greeks laid the foundations for West to develop liberal democracy. 
He notes that the radicial individualist approach of the West has many benefits and complications.

## Personal Insights: 
I found the tone of this lecture to be very conservative/eurocentric and after some quick research into the Professor I discovered his political attitudes shifted to neocon in 1969 after the [establishment of a Black Studies course at Cornell](https://apnews.com/article/europe-arts-and-entertainment-d8745b078b9d515e5a75a573d9216fe4).
Eurocentrism could be expected somewhat given the topic of the course but I felt there was a general and excessive praise for the West being the pinnacle of civilization that went far beyond the discussion of the Ancient Greeks with little discussion around the negatives.
Note: I'm writing this reflection 2 days after watching the lecture so the above are just the things that stuck with me.
